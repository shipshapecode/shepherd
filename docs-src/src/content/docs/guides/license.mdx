## Framework Wrappers

### React Shepherd

The `react-shepherd` wrapper is licensed under MIT, but it depends on `shepherd.js` which is AGPL-3.0. 

If you need a commercial license for Shepherd.js, you also need one when using the React wrapper.

### Other Wrappers

- [Angular Shepherd](https://github.com/shipshapecode/angular-shepherd)
- [Vue Shepherd](https://github.com/shipshapecode/vue-shepherd)
- [Ember Shepherd](https://github.com/RobbieTheWagner/ember-shepherd)

All wrappers depend on the core Shepherd.js library and inherit its licensing requirements.
